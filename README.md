# Recipe App Rest API

API built using Docker, Django, Postgres and Swagger. Great example API for use in future projects. This project was made alongside Udemy course 'Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django - Advanced' to help improve my skills in test-driven development and creating rest APIs.
